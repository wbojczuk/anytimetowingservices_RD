Not only did he come out promptly, but he also removed my old car battery, drove me to AutoZone to purchase a new one, and then installed it on the spot.

His professionalism, friendliness, and dedication were outstanding. He turned what could have been a very stressful day into a smooth and hassle-free experience. I highly recommend Shane/ Anytime Roadside Services to anyone in need of reliable and top-notch mobile mechanic services. Thank you so much for your help today—you truly saved the day!`

        desc: `Shane is so kind and helpful! He pulled my son’s car out of a snow bank and towed his car to safety! I really appreciate how fast his service was, and how thoughtful he was in this stressful situation. His rate was more than fair and not what that competition had quoted (which, btw, was insanely high) I definitely suggest that you use Shane’s tow company if you ever find yourself in trouble.
