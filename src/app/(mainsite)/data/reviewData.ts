        desc: `Shane is so kind and helpful! He pulled my son’s car out of a snow bank and towed his car to safety! I really appreciate how fast his service was, and how thoughtful he was in this stressful situation. His rate was more than fair and not what that competition had quoted (which, btw, was insanely high) I definitely suggest that you use Shane’s tow company if you ever find yourself in trouble.

I called and spoke with Shane and was so relieved when he showed up 20 minutes later excellent customer service excellent prices I highly recommend my daughter and her family all live in this area and I told them about what he did for me and they are only going to use this company from now on. Amazing people very happy thanks Shane`
